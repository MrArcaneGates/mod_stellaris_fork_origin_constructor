 modifier_origin_fotd_desc:0 "A century ago, one of the planets in this empire's home system was destroyed by a freak asteroid. Some believed this was a malicious attack by an alien species. Others brushed off these concerns as mere paranoia. The tension between the two groups grew so great that a newly-terraformed planet was granted to the fearmongers.\n\n §EEffects§!:\n- Start with a third of your population refusing to explore space, living on a separate planet.\n- The separatist planet will provide unique events and benefits."

 modifier_origin_mechanist_desc:0 "This civilization has been preoccupied with the idea of metallic automatons since the early Steam Age.
